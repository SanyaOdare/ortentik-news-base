Instructions on how to create the environment variables.

Get started with cloning your own project repository from GitHub onto your local machine. 
You can do this by navigating to the directory where you want to store the project 
and running the following command in your terminal:
git clone <repository_url>

Next, navigate into the project directory using the terminal: 
cd <project_directory>

Now, create a new file named .env in the root directory of your project.

Open the .env file using a text editor and define the environment variables in the following format: 
VARIABLE_NAME=value

Replace VARIABLE_NAME with the preferred name of your environment variable and value with its corresponding value.

Save the .env file after adding your environment variables.
